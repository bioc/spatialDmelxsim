Description: Spatial allelic expression counts from Combs & Fraser (2018),
    compiled into a SummarizedExperiment object. This package contains data
    of allelic expression counts of spatial slices of a fly embryo,
    a Drosophila melanogaster x Drosophila simulans cross. See the CITATION
    file for the data source, and the associated script for how the object
    was constructed from publicly available data.
